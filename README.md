## Why participate?

A coding question a day keeps the fear of Data Structures and Algorithms away!

## Why particiapte with Girl Code It?

All the participants discuss their solution approaches everyday at the end of the day, by which :

- Everyone gets to know all the possible approaches of solving a question.
- If you were not able to solve the question, the other participants will help you solve it.
- Most importantly, particpating with a whole group keeps you consistent and motivated for solving questions each day.
